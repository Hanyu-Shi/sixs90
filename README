This code is an update of 6S.

I assume you are familar with 6S radiative transfer model. http://6s.ltdri.org/

I rewrite the code in free form style. I try to keep original source code as much as possible 
	but add necessary declaration of variables and modify all float (real) type variables to 
	double precision type. Three surface BRDF models are added, which are PROSAIL (version 5B),
	ACRM(version 12.2012), and a snow reflectance model. I modify these code for convenience 
	to be coupled in 6S.

Currently, the latest version of 6S are 6SV2.1.

Sevreral bugs are fixed,
1) subroutine akalbe. In AKTOOL.f90 line 1656 (AKTOOL.f line 1545), the dimensions of variables
	uu and aa are changed to 48 to keep consistent with the parameters in subroutine dakg.
2) mainlutaero.f90 line 2466 (mainlutaero.f line 2508), pveg = ul -> pveg = uli
3) subroutine iso. In ISO.f90 line 38, add the initialization of xmus, xmus = rm(0)
4) subroutine disom. In DISCOM.f90 line 60 (DISCOM.f line 64), modify two if statements to 
	avoid memory problems when compiling by Intel Visual Fortran on a Windows platform.

There are two main functions, main.f90 and mainlutaero.f90. The Makefile in sixs90 folder is 
	recommend, or you can compile them separately in your IDE.

Although the code is in free form style, many statements are written using old synatax. You can
	help improve and extend this code.
